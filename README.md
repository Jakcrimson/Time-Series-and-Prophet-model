# Time-Series-and-Prophet-model
This repo contains an overview of how Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models work on financial data from the Yahoo finance api. It also includes a short overview of the Facebook Prophet Model.

## Why 
This project has a teaching purpose, i've been interested in time series for a long time and financial data is one of the most common applications to start with.

## With what
I've been able to write the notebooks with the help of papers on Towards Data Science and Medium (for the Facebook Prophet model setup I refered directly to the repository's documentation).

## In order to .. ?
Get to know how time series work and maybe find other fields of application, visualizing data (geodata for example ;) ), comparing algorithms. But most of all I wanted to prepare myself for internship this summer 2022 at PureControl in Rennes. I will probably be working on time series and time data analysis.
